*Q: How does AsciiDocLIVE work?*

AsciiDocLIVE uses
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[asciidoctor.js pass:[<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>]^]
to compile AsciiDoc to HTML right inside your browser.
asciidoctor.js is cross-compiled from
http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor pass:[<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>]^],
an implementation of AsciiDoc in Ruby.

The text editor inside AsciiDocLIVE is https://ace.c9.io/[Ace editor pass:[<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>]^].

*Q: Is AsciiDocLIVE fully compatible with AsciiDoc?*

No. Please refer to
http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-asciidoctor-diffs/[Differences between Asciidoctor and AsciiDoc pass:[<i class="fa fa-external-link"></i>]^]
for a list of minor incompatibilities with the original AsciiDoc implementation.

*Q: Does AsciiDocLIVE store or keep a copy of my documents?*

No. No document data is ever sent to AsciiDocLIVE. Your documents are compiled
to HTML right inside your browser on your local computer. If you save a document
to Dropbox or Google Drive, that document goes straight from your computer to
Dropbox / Google, without ever going through AsciiDocLIVE.
